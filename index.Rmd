## Research

I have been working with Dr. Laura Rozek, professor of Epidemiology, and Dr. Sartor, professor of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan on their cancer research.  I analyzed previously collected data for the Greek Oral Dysplasia Study.  This study is a longitudinal study looking at the progression of oral epithelial dysplasias and if they lead to oral squamous cell carcinomas in a cohort of patients in Greece. 

During my internship at John Wiley & Sons, Inc., [I analyzed impact factor and submission data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1285).
